## 🎯 What is SkillSwap?

Imagine wanting to learn **Unity 3D** but courses are too expensive, and volunteer tutors don't offer it. Now imagine you already know **Music Production**. What if you could find someone who knows Unity and wants to learn Music Production?

**That's SkillSwap.** 

We match people who can teach each other's desired skills—creating a **mutual learning partnership** where both sides win. No money. No generic courses. Just **1-on-1, accountable, live learning**.

### 🌟 Why This Matters

- **Traditional courses** → Not interactive, expensive, no accountability
- **Volunteer tutoring** → Limited subjects, group classes, inflexible curricula  
- **SkillSwap** → **Free, personalized, mutual, global**

## 💡 The Story Behind SkillSwap

> *"I was building a philosophy video game in Unity and needed to learn character movement. Online courses didn't keep me accountable. Volunteer tutors didn't offer Unity. Classes were too expensive. I realized: **What if I could trade my Music Production skills for someone's Unity knowledge?** That question became SkillSwap."*

**The Big Idea**: Everyone wants to learn something. Everyone can teach something. By connecting these dots, we solve both problems at once.

---

## 🔮 What's Next? (Version 2.0)

### ⏱️ Time Banking System

Currently, SkillSwap requires **mutual matches** (you teach what they want, they teach what you want). But what if matches are one-sided?

**Solution: Time Credits**
- Teach someone for 1 hour → Earn **60 Time Credits**
- Use credits to learn from someone who *isn't* a mutual match
- Creates a **circular economy of knowledge**

**Example:**
```
Person X (wants Unity, teaches Music) 
    ↓ gives 60 credits
Person Y (teaches Unity, wants Photography)
    ↓ gives 60 credits  
Person Z (teaches Photography, wants Music)
    ↓ gives 60 credits back to Person X
```

Everyone learns. Everyone teaches. The cycle continues. 🔄
